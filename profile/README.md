# Lexicon Community

A working group to create community AT Protocol Lexicons.

Follow https://bsky.app/profile/lexicon.community for updates and announcements.

AT Protocol https://atproto.com supports the definition of data types through what are called Lexicons. rather than each app creating their own unique Lexicons, this working group is designed to jointly define and improve Lexicon types that can be used across apps.

For example, a "link" Lexicon at `community.lexicon.link` could be used by both Frontpage and LinkAt and a hypothetical future bookmarks type.
